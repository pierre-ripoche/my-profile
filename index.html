				<h2> Video games 🎮 </h2>
				<p> I am passionate of video games since times I can't even remember. The first game I ever was named Gex, it was a platformer where the protagonist was a lezard trying to escape obscur forces while he's stuck in his TV. Weirdly amazing.</p>

				<h2> お前はもう死んでいる 👘 </h2>
				<p> You may not have understood what was written here! It means "You are already dead" in japanese and it is pronounced “Omae wa mou shindeiru”. As you can guess I love japanese animation and manga! I'm a huge fan of the nekketsu kind (it means boiling blood) and my favourite anime is One Piece. </p>

				<h2> Playing the guitare 🎸</h2>
				<p> I've been playing the guitare since I'm in CM2, and ever since I loved spending hours on it. Even though my family lost patience with time, I still love playing guitar for hours, finding new melodies, trying on new rythmics and chords. I definitely think it would be the item to take on a desert island</p>

				<h2> Rap 🎙️ </h2>
				<p> I like rap music since I am a kid, but I really started to be interested in it since 4-5 years. I listen mainly to french rap, but early I tried to listen to USA rappers, which I loved. I think rap is most the diversified type of music, with sonorities close to the blues, rock, pop, RnB and texts something close to poetry. My favorite rapper was for a long time Ninho, but these times I tend to listen more to old school musics suc as Hugo TSR or Remy.  </p>
